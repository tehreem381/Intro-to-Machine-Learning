Introduction to Machine Learning – Kaggle 
This repository contains practice exercises. The work follows the Kaggle Intro to Machine Learning course and focuses on building, validating, and improving regression models using Python and Scikit-learn.

Course Exercises
How Models Work
Basic Data Exploration
Your First Machine Learning Model
Model Validation
Underfitting and Overfitting
Random Forests
Machine Learning Competitions
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy

Dataset
The exercises use the Iowa House Prices dataset from Kaggle. The objective is to predict house sale prices based on structured features such as lot area, year built, floor size, number of rooms, and bathrooms.

Learning Outcomes
Through this coursework, I gained practical experience in:

Data exploration and preprocessing
Training regression models
Evaluating models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Handling overfitting and underfitting
Applying ensemble methods such as Random Forest
